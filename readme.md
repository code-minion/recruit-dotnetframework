# Assignment
Create a backend .NET API using this empty project (this repo) for this [frontend repository](https://github.com/EdenCoNz/recruit-react/)

In addition to providing the API for the frontend application, we want you to add a feature to call a 3rd party API for the validation.

Please note that you do not need to create the frontend code for this project unless specified, you simply need to provide the backend service that would be used for the imaginary frontend

## Bradley's Notes

So for this assignment I kept most of the constraints that the project initially had when I cloned it (.net framework 4.7.2).

I noted that the project had a missing 'Models' folder, so I created one and added a 'CreditCard' model to it.

'App_Data' is also missing, but I don't actually need that so I left it out.

I am aware the test is checking for 'Code Structure and Architecture', but given I only need 2 files to make this work, I decided that less is more here.
